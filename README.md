# Gans-ETL-Pipeline
Development of ETL pipeline for electric scooter company through webscraping and API, storing data into SQL.

## Summary
This repository contains the * *development of an ETL pipeline* * of the fictitious company Gans: a startup developing an e-scooter-sharing system. 
This case study focuses building a * *database* * that provides the company Gans with data that, when analyzed, helps identifying the most strategic parking spots of their e-scooters in many cities. The main goal of this task was collecting data from external sources that can potentially help Gans predict e-scooter movement in the future.

## Languages and Libraries Used
Python | Libraries: Pandas, BeautifulSoup, Datetime, Requests, Pytz, Pymysql, Sql Alchemy | 
SQL 
## Key Learnings
**Webscraping**: used the Python Beautiful Soup library to retreive demographic information for first static table in database. 
**API data collection**: used open APIs to retreive information about flights and weather. 
**SQL database creation**: pushed all dataframes to SQL to create a relational database. 

## Challenges Overcame
Building robust code to retreive information for any city and any value that the data carries.
